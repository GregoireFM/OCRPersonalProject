First personal project : Training and racing targets

Dear user,

First things first, a little explanation of each value used in the .csv files (simplified for ease of use).

CSS: Critical Swim Speed // Your average pace over a 400m swim test.
unit= t/100m // Format= hh:mm:ss

FTP: Functional Threshold Power // The average power you can hold for about 45' to 1h (95% of a 20' test power).
unit= W // Format= Standard number

LTHR: Lactate Threshold Heart Rate // Heart rate you can hold for 1h of cycling or running (can be different).
unit= bpm // Format= Standard number

Threshold pace: Your 10km running best possible average pace.
unit= t/km // Format= hh:mm:ss



You can run the script directly, as I have set values for each.

For your own results, just replace the values by yours in each entry file.

Run the script and navigate through the menus to request what you wish to see.


Have a great day !
